Image Processing & Color Analysis (Task 09)

This Python program allows users to upload an image and performs comprehensive color analysis and processing. It converts the uploaded image into grayscale and separates the RGB channels, displaying them individually. The program also converts the image into different color spaces including HSV, YCbCr, and Lab. It performs white balance adjustment using the Gray World method, highlights specific colors using color masking (e.g., green), and applies Lab-based segmentation to extract features using thresholding. All intermediate and final results, including the original, processed, masked, and segmented images, are displayed side by side for easy visualization and comparison.

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Google Colab files
